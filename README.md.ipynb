    "## Game Summary\n",
    "This is a simple tapping game where the player aims to hit as many green blocks as they can within a time limit. The more successful hits, the higher their score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Being able to see the incoming blocks, players can know which button to hit ahead of time. The game challenges the player's focus, hand-eye coordination and reaction time.   \n",
    "\n",
    "Addtitonally, various comments are displayed based on the obtained score which encourages them to play more.    \n",
    "\n",
    "## How to Play\n",
    "### Main \n",
    "1. Tap on the **'Start'** button to transition to gameplay     screen \n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "2. To successfully shoot a green box, tap on the shoot button when there is a green box in the row directly above it.<br>Alternatively, you can use your keyboard as well:\n",
    "    - W = Left Button\n",
    "    - E or O = Middle Button\n",
    "    - P = Right Button   \n",
    "\n",
    " *Each row will always have only 1 green box* and you can see 4 rows of incoming green to tap.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Once you make the first successful shot, the Timer would start and is displayed on the top left and Score in the center. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Hit as many as you can within 30 seconds and your final score would appear once the timer ends. There is a bonus comment based on what you scored. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Tap on the **'Close'** button to return to the start screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Additional\n",
    "- To prematurely end the game, tap on the **'Leave'** button in the top right of the game screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Instructions can be found by tapping **'Instructions'** button in the start screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- To close the application, tap the **'Quit'** button in the start screen. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Code\n",
    "By using Kivy, the game feels more authentic as user only needs to interact with the UI while code runs in background. Kivy keeps the code 'clean' as a majority of the UI code and some functions can be written neatly in the `.kv` file. Code in `python` file reserved for creating functions of the `widgets` in UI.  \n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "Not all kivy classes had to be imported as a majority could be accessed via the `.kv` file. Only import ones we have to access directly in the python code.\n",

    "- `game.kv` file must be saved in same location as `PewPew` file.\n",
    "- `GameApp().run()` must be at the very end of your code to run the app.\n",
